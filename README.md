# Algorithms Solutions

This Algorithms repository contains my implementations of a few problem solving questions using data structures..

## How to use them

A few of the classes have main() method with test data set. Execute them as Java Application in your preferred choice of IDE. Other classes which do not have main() method, you need to add your own main method to invoke the solution.

## Contribute 

The solutions have been tested with a wide variety of test inputs. However , in case you find a bug, please raise an issue. Fork the repo and create a pull request to merge into the source repo
